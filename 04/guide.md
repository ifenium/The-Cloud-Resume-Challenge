# [Static Website](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/#4-static-website)

> Your HTML resume should be deployed online as an Azure Storage static website. 
Services like Netlify and GitHub Pages are great and I would normally recommend them for personal static site deployments, 
but they make things a little too abstract for our purposes here. Use Azure Storage.

In today's task, I'll be deploying my resume I coded in HTML & CSS as a static webopage as an Azure Storage Static Website. 

I would be following a tutorial provided by [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-how-to?tabs=azure-portal) on this specific matter as I have no intention of reinventing the wheel :-)
